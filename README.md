**Research Trend Radar**

A sleek, futuristic dashboard for tracking and visualizing trending research topics and recent papers across various scientific domains. Built for researchers, academics, and enthusiasts, this tool provides a dynamic and intuitive way to stay on top of the latest advancements.

How It Works
The Research Trend Radar operates on a robust data pipeline that scrapes, processes, and analyzes academic papers. It's powered by data from prominent open-access platforms, including arXiv. The core functionality involves:

**Data Ingestion**: A dedicated scraping service pulls the latest paper submissions.

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Machine learning models analyze the content of abstracts and keywords to identify emerging topics and cluster related papers.

**Trend Detection**: Algorithms track the growth and interconnectedness of these clusters over time to pinpoint what's truly trending.

**Features**

**Multi-Domain Tracking**: Easily switch between different research fields (e.g., AI/ML, Biotechnology, Renewable Energy) to monitor trends relevant to your interests.

**Dark, High-Tech Interface**: A visually stunning design inspired by sci-fi dashboards, featuring a deep black background with vibrant purple and teal accents.

**Dynamic Topic Visualization**: Displays trending research topics, their associated papers, and keywords in an intuitive, engaging format.

**Interactive Filtering**: A collapsible sidebar provides powerful filtering options for keywords, categories, and date ranges.

**Interactive Filtering**: Includes a word cloud of trending keywords and a bar chart showing paper distribution per topic for at-a-glance data insights.
